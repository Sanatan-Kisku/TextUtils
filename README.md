# TextUtils

TextUtils is a web app that allows you to perform various operations on text, such as converting to uppercase, lowercase, title case, removing punctuation, counting words and characters, etc. It is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React Components.

## How to use

You can clone this repository or download it as a zip file. Then, run the following commands in your terminal:
